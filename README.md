Kit
===

A dependency management tool for Obj-C/Xcode projects.

Install
-------

    $ brew install haskell-platform
    # Make sure ~/Library/Haskell/bin is on your PATH. (~/.cabal/bin for older versions of the platform)
    $ cabal install kit

Usage
-----

See [functionalkit](https://github.com/mogeneration/functionalkit) for an example of a publishable dependency. The important part of it is the KitSpec file in the root. It follows a default [structure](https://github.com/nkpart/kit/wiki/Kit-structure).

Documentation is slowly emerging in the wiki.
